# acerola-jam-0

My entry into the acerola jam 0

## notes

- would be cool to have arm alternate its approach each time (just invert renderer and switch angle)
- probably need to seperate the vectors for up and down collectively in physics calculations
- COULD NOT REPLICATE: bug where if you walk into two colliders at once you phase
- you berserk to get keybinds switched which is the only time you can attack
  - you have a metetr which brings you back to normal binds later on as your HR decreases

## ideas

increasing amount of blood dripping until you get to door with key, then binds change to nothing. cant move and you realize and die

## big remaining tasks

enemies spawn and transform triggers

bloody vignette is messed up

enemies hit you and deal damage

ending condition keys on door

transform triggers and sensible binds

lore drop clipboards all around (they exposed you as radiation on purpose)

end cutscene police scene coverup ty for playing

## list of transformations

once before blue card

once when walking to green card room location

after grabbing keys

one right before you reach the door - kickstarts ending
