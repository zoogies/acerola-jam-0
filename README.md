# Theriac (Acerola Jam 0 Submission)

Theriac is a horror game developed in yoyoengine for the Acerola Jam 0.

You are a broke college student, newly diagnosed with brain cancer. It seems completely hopeless, until you receive a letter offering compensation for your time in a clinical trial- one that could also remove your brain tumor entirely. 

With nothing else to lose, you sign up.
